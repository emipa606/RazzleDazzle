For those players who want a little more song and dance in the lives of their colonies! This mod introduces a range of performing arts:

Theatre:  Colonists can write (Artistic) and perform plays (Social), which are written at sculpting benches.

Music:    Music can be composed (Artistic) and performed at a piano (Social).

Stand-up: Rehearsed and performed at the microphone stand (Social).

Radio: Performances from all of the above will be automatically broadcast if you have a broadcaster, with subscription payments sent in by nearby settlements based on the quality of your broadcast.

Now you can keep your colonists from ever doing a real day's work!
